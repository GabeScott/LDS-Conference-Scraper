# LDS-Conference-Scraper
To my knowledge, a dataset of every talk given at LDS conferences has not been compiled. This is a dataset gathered through scraping https://www.lds.org/general-conference/conferences?lang=eng

This dataset is useful for statistical analysis or machine learning techniques such as natural language processing
