# LDS-Conference-Scraper
To my knowledge, a dataset of every talk given at LDS conferences has not been compiled. It is gathered by scraping https://www.lds.org/general-conference/conferences?lang=eng

* Possibly useful for statistical analysis or machine learning techniques such as natural language processing 
* There are more than 3700 unique talks included
* While the script includes some simple removing of '\n's and '\t's and some encoded strings, more cleaning is necessary to build a higher quality dataset.
